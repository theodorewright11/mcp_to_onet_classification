186,Instagit - Let Your Agents Instantly Understand Any Github Repo,"Works with Claude Code, Claude Desktop, Cursor, OpenClaw, and any MCP-compatible client. The @latest tag ensures you always get the most recent version.

Why
Agents that integrate with external libraries are flying blind. They read docs (if they exist), guess at APIs, and hallucinate patterns that don't match the actual code. The result: broken integrations, wrong function signatures, outdated usage patterns, hours of debugging.

When an agent can actually analyze the source code of a library or service it's integrating with, everything changes. It sees the real function signatures, the actual data flow, the patterns the maintainers intended. Integration becomes dramatically easier and less error-prone because the agent is working from ground truth, not guesses.

What Agents Can Do With This
- Integrate with any library correctly the first time — ""How do I set up authentication with this SDK?"" gets answered from the actual code, not outdated docs or training data. Your agent sees the real constructors, the real config options, the real error types.
- Migrate between versions without the guesswork — Point your agent at both the old and new version of a library. It can diff the actual implementations and generate a migration plan that accounts for every breaking change.
- Debug issues across repository boundaries — When a bug spans your code and a dependency, your agent can read both codebases and trace the issue to its root cause — even into libraries you've never opened.
- Generate integration code that actually works — Instead of producing plausible-looking code that fails at runtime, your agent writes integration code based on the real API surface: actual method names, actual parameter types, actual return values.
- Evaluate libraries before committing — ""Should we use library A or B?"" Your agent can analyze both implementations, compare their approaches to error handling, test coverage, and architectural quality, and give you a grounded recommendation.
- Onboard to unfamiliar codebases in minutes — Point your agent at any repo and ask how things work. It answers from the code itself, with file paths and line numbers, not from memory that may be months out of date.",https://mcp.so/server/instagit---let-your-agents-instantly-understand-any-github-repo/Instagit ,,,
188,Trainedby.ai,"trainedby.ai - Your AI fitness coach, but with actual data

Connect your wearables (Garmin, Oura, Whoop, Apple Health, 50+ platforms) to ChatGPT or Claude. Your AI coach finally knows your real training load, sleep, and recovery—without you typing a word.

The Problem

People use ChatGPT for marathon training, strength programs, and fitness planning. It's knowledgeable and available 24/7.

But every conversation starts from zero. You describe your fitness level, paste Garmin screenshots, try to remember last week's workouts and how you slept. The advice is based on what you told it, not what actually happened.

The Solution

trainedby.ai connects your wearables directly to your AI assistant. When you open ChatGPT and ask about training, it already knows:





Recent workouts (weeks, months, year)



Sleep quality and patterns



HRV and resting HR trends



Recovery metrics and training load



Nutrition and cycle data (if tracked)

No context dumps. No guessing. Just real data.

How It Works

Smart compression turns raw wearable data into trends AI can understand—elevated RHR, declining HRV, poor sleep consistency. Data rolls up from days → weeks → months → years. Add notes for goals, injuries, and availability. Then just chat.
